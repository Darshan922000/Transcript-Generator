      "So, I'm an entrepreneur. I started my first company when I was 21 years old. And it uh grew to be a business that was doing 10.7 million in the first 3 years. Um, since then, I think I've done seven startups that went 0 to a million in their first 12 months. I've had three businesses go north of 10 million. Um, so I'm very much a startup founder. I get involved in starting things. My passion is starting things from scratch. Um, today I run a group of seven companies which are a combination of businesses that I've started or bought. Um, and I run an entrepreneur accelerator that's worked with five and a half thousand companies globally that helps them to stand out, scale up, and make a positive impact in the world. And I've written five uh bestselling books on entrepreneurship and and startup culture. So, being someone that's built up so many different multi-million dollar businesses, what opportunities at this exact moment would you say are the hottest? Because I feel like back in the day it was Shopify, drop shipping. I feel like for a moment in time, people wanted to be like day traders and that hype has kind of died down. Yeah. could what like even Amazon uh FBA that was a big one. What would you say right now are the main opportunities available? So I want to answer this in three parts. Opportunity one, opportunity two and then how to think about that question. So uh opportunity one is a personal brand linked to an elegant scalable business model. So if you can build a personal brand, if you can have or if you can find someone who has a personal brand and let's call it you know that they have 100,000 plus followers and they've got a good relationship with those followers and then you can link that personal brand to an elegant scalable business model that is the probably the number one opportunity in the world and when you see this you'll see it everywhere. So, like for example, this drink is Chris Williamson and his business partner who are both influencers. They've both got big personal brands and they figured out uh we can put a scalable business model on the back of that. Um you see this with J Shetty, you see this with um uh Driver CEO Steven Bartlett. So, you're going to start seeing everywhere that the influencers are not taking sponsorships anymore. They're just going to bolt businesses onto their own. They're going to do influence for equity. they're going to basically use their influence uh to generate enough cash flow to live on and then the additional influence goes into building equity value of a business that's scalable. Um and this is going to be a really sensible investable scalable business opportunity for a long time. Now if you don't have a huge brand you can be the one who finds a good business and links it to a personal brand. You can be a partner to someone who is uh has a personal brand. So that's opportunity number one. And that's probably one of the biggest opportunities in the world. Second biggest opportunity is the one Cody Sanchez talks a lot about uh which is taking over a baby boomer business. Baby boomers are aged 61 to 79. They have more than half the economy in their hands. So 52% of all value is in the hands of a small group of people who are 61 to 79. They have something like 70% of all business equity. Um so businesses by valuation mostly are owned by baby boomers. But they're at that stage of life where they don't want to be running those businesses anymore. They want to pass them down. And there is a demand and supply imbalance of the number of people who want to pass over a business versus who they can pass that business to. And that represents a huge opportunity for younger people. Um like one of the coolest things you could do, I was talking to some young guys the other day. they're going to be buying a landscape gardening business and the business is in decline and has been in decline for about four or five years and it still does more than seven figures of revenue, but it's in decline. And as soon as they just went and did some testing where they knocked on a few doors, what we did is got them to take an iPad, you go uh take a photo of the front uh of the house, you ask chat GBT to show what this house would look like fully landscaped, go up to the front door and say, \"Hey, we've done a rendering of your house, what it would look like fully landscaped.\" And people go, \"Wow, that's incredible.\" Chad GBT's renderings, especially for like interior design, are incredible. Their ability, if you just say, \"Hey, make it like this style.\" You don't even know what the proper nomenclature is, like words for a certain style. You just tell, \"Oh, I want it a little bit more elegant, a little bit more hard angles and stuff like\" and it makes crazy renderings. Yeah, it's wild. And it's free. Like these are the types of things that used to cost maybe a few hundred and take a few weeks. So there was no way you could possibly go doortodoor showing people what the house would look like. Anyway, that's an example where the baby boomer is not going to do that. They don't have the energy for it. They're not they're not in that phase of life. But a younger person who takes over that business, vendor financed, they they buy the business with the previous owner financing them into the deal. Then they apply some technology, they apply some energy, and away they go. They've got that. Do you think this is something the average person can do though? like with now that we can access you know cheaper labor in all these different countries and we have a global network and you have access to things like chatbt that it's then decreased the bar in terms of like skill necessary for being a successful entrepreneur because the common argument against this is that not everyone can be an entrepreneur like there's certain skills and and maybe personality traits and character traits that are ne necessary in order to be an effective I not everyone can be an entrepreneur not everyone should be an entrepreneur Um, with that said, everyone can be part of an entrepreneurial team and you're going to have a lot more fun being part of an entrepreneurial team than being part of a big corporate. So, if you have an experience, I think you had an experience of going into an investment bank when you were young and they just shoved you in a corner. Data entry. Yeah. Got you doing and you like just tried to say hello to the boss and he's like, \"You're not allowed to say hello to me directly.\" Or the manager, the chain of command. Yeah. The shame of command, right? You know, awful. You are not allowed to talk to the boss, right? directly like that's the kind of nonsense that people put up with in corporate jobs. Um so you know if you had have worked for an amazing founder with less than 10 12 other people on the team. So like not everyone can or should be an entrepreneur but there are um you can be part of entrepreneurial teams. Uh the you know entrepreneurship is a team sport. One role on the team is captain of the team, founder, you know, that that sort of thing. But there are plenty of other roles. Like in my entrepreneurial team, you know, I've got a CFO and a COO uh and a C chief revenue officer. I've got like people on my team who are earning a lot of money. They've got equity ownership in the businesses. I might have started those businesses, but they are part owners in those businesses and they're earning a lot of money and getting a lot of uh value from it. So you don't have to like if you think being an entrepreneur means um that you are a founder that you're starting from scratch. Not everyone can or should do that. Who should not be an entrepreneur? Well, you you said the word average. You know, if you're if you've got enough self-awareness to say, \"I'm average at the moment. I'm just an average person.\" Go join a team with someone who's above average. You know, that's that's totally normal. It's normal to be average. Average is normal, right? So, like we we we all think that we should be in the top 1%. 99% of people can't be in the top 1%, but we can get around those people. Um, you know, you did pretty well if you're on the same team as Michael Jordan back in, you know, back in the day. So, um, I I'm a really big believer that um, you do an entrepreneur apprenticeship, you do at least two years working around someone. I think you guys met through like almost you were Yeah. Yeah. It was I mean we all kind of had the same story of like you know reaching out to someone who was successful in a space we were interested in provided them with free work uh which a lot of people don't like when we say oh gosh people get so triggered when I say go and work for free go and work for free yeah well there there you go you're going to get but the counterargument to that is what if I'm supporting a family I got three kids at home I'm barely making ends meet I get I come home at 8 p.m. I can't afford to work for free. And the people who can work for free have all of these uh things working in their favor. For starters, for starters, life's not fair. Like, at no point in human history has it been fair. Just get over that idea that it should be fair and that like here's the thing. You've got three kids. That's not fair. That's amazing. That's an incredible blessing that your family's got that some other people don't have, right? So, count your blessings for what you've got. But with having I'm a father of three kids, there are certain things you just can't do. There are young entrepreneurs who can outperform me because I also have a commitment to drop my kids at school every morning and they're working when I'm dropping the kids at school. That's it. That's fine, right? We all have there's no fairness. There's just trade-offs. Now, what you what you need to do is find a way. So, finding a way might be that 80% of your time you do the stuff that pays the bills and you take on a little bit of uh additional work uh in order to get your foot in the door. All all we're talking about with get all we're talking about with work for free is normally that advice is pitched at young people who don't have much experience to leverage and it's like just get your foot in the door. You're not actually working for free. What you're doing is you're providing your labor in exchange for higher level experience than you could normally get your hands on. So you're there's an exchange going on. It may not be a direct cash exchange, but the exchange is hey I'm going to invite you in above your pay grade, right? And you're going to you're going to be in an environment where you get to jump up. I have got a dozen 12 uh ex employees who are now millionaires because they came and worked uh for me and around me and they did two to three or four years working for me and then they went off and did their own business or they took over their family business and now they're multi-millionaires. My existant took over his father's business that was 500 grand a year and it's now 5 million a year. Um two young guys who were on my sales team. um they met on the sales team, they came up with their idea on the sales team, they uh left, they started a business and they sold it for $7 million. So, you know, and these guys early 20s. So, you know, realistically, if you want to work in close proximity with me, like a lot of people would pay a lot of money to do that. So, it's like paying for college. Yeah. Exactly. So, yeah. People go, \"Oh, you can't work for free.\" But you can go to college and get into debt, right? See, it's so funny. I said the same thing uh with Caleb Hammer and he had one of his employees with him and his employee was talking about how much he was making and I said I thought that was great that he's getting paid for this because people would pay Caleb for that same job and people got so upset that here I am advocating for free labor but at the same time I'm thinking like when you look objectively at the opportunity that that what what Caleb is doing and how much that's valuable to somebody else who wants to do that. I mean like people should like his value I think is worth like 80 grand just to pay Caleb just to see how his team works. But look at I mean just look at anyone who's a high performer. They you know they ate glass for several years in one form or another. You know Ed Sheeran busking on the streets day after day after day while writing his songs getting his performance skills. You get the comedians who do like years of like little tiny clubs and then they get their breakthrough. Um, so it's just it's just a way to accelerate. And by the way, you don't have to do that. It just takes longer. Like working for free is just an accelerant. So all we're talking about is do you want to accelerate the time that it takes? It's no no different to this. When I first arrived in London 2006, I arrived with a suitcase and a credit card. And I don't know anyone. I've never been above the equator in my life. Born in Australia, moving to London for the first time. Um, and I thought, okay, I want to accelerate the time that it takes to be successful in this city. So, I rented a private dining room at a nice restaurant for 30 people. I reached out and found the who's who in the business scene that I was uh entering and I invited them to a a private dinner and there was 28 people who came along. They mostly came to see each other. So, I kind of reached out and said, \"Hey, look, I'm coordinating. This is the guest list. These are the people who I'm inviting.\" And they, \"Oh, okay. I'll go because so and so's there.\" So, I brought together this group of 28 people. Um, I pay for dinner. I I put the whole thing up. During the dinner, I stand up and I say, \"Hey, look, I'm Daniel. I've just arrived. I'm I'm young. I'm 25. I've just arrived uh from Australia. Uh, it's my first time in in London. Uh, I'm looking to start a business. Um, ideally, I'd love to have a one-to-one meeting with you. I've just joined a a great little members club for business. Uh, if you're happy to have a meeting with me, I'm going to head around and make a time.\" So I go around and I book 24 oneto ons. Uh we I then do in the following two weeks I do 24 oneto ones and out of all of it I I think I agreed 20 joint venture affiliate partnerships where they were going to email their email list uh and help promote my launch event. Day of launch event 800 uh bookings come in for our first launch event. Uh I think a total was about3 or 4,000 across the rest of the week. Um, in our first six months, we did4 million pounds worth of sales. Now, 5% of businesses in the UK get to a million or more ever. I did4 million worth of sales in our first 6 months. Now, why why did we do that? Cuz I accelerated. I I said, \"For the cost of putting on a dinner party and buying 30 people dinner, for the cost of buying cups of coffee and and creating a deal, oh, by the way, the deal for them to get involved with my launch was also I'm going to run a launch event. The launch event is going to have a ticket price and 200% of the ticket price goes to you as an affiliate commission.\" So, the ticket price was like 30. And I said, \"We pay 60.\" So, for every person who pays 30, we'll pay you 60. How'd you afford to do that? Were you just was there upselles at the end that you just tanked on? Well, we just knew that we were going to we were going to sign up clients. So, I I set it up from the beginning that when we've signed up all those clients, we'll owe you the the commissions. Um, but we will owe you that amount of money. Um, I just I just bu built a little system and and executed.\n"
